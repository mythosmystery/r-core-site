               This shop was recommended by a trusted mechanic friend. Expedient turnaround. Clean job. Competitive price. Good warranty. Experience.
               Professional & knowledgeable staff. It's been a few months since our F-body 4L60E was rebuilt. So far so good.

               R Core has rebuilt two transmissions for me in the past and they have worked flawlessly . Took my truck by for them to look at today
               because it had symptoms of either a transmission problem or possibly an electrical issue. An R core technician test drove the truck and
               came back to report that it was not a transmission problem. He suggested instead to replace some specific electrical items to resolve
               the problem. The honesty is outstanding and they have a customer for life. Really appreciate these guys.... you will too.

               Randy is awesome. Great business. I had my truck towed from Tulsa just for him to repair. Had my transmission rebuilt in 2 days. Up and
               running. Reasonable and honest. Hard to find now days. I recommend this shop. You won't be disappointed.
